* Data preparation
** Dataset description report
*** Background including broad goals and plan for preprocessing
*** Rationale for inclusion/exclusion of datasets 
For each included dataset: 
- Description of the preprocessing, including the actions that were necessary to address any data quality issues
- Detailed description of the resultant dataset, table by table and field by field
- Rationale for inclusion/exclusion of attributes
- Discoveries made during preprocessing and anu implications for futher work
- Summary and conclusions
* Modeling 
** Modeling asumption
** Test design
*** Background - outlines the modeling undertaken and its relation to the data minig goals
For each modeling task: 
- Broad description of the type of model and the training data to be used 
- Explanation of how the model will be tested or assessed 
- Description of any data required for testing 
- Plan for production of test data if any
- Description of any planned examination of models by domain or data experts
- Summary of test plan

** Model description 
*** Overview of models produced 
For each model:
- Type of model and relation to data mining goals 
- Parameter settings used to produce the model 
- Detailed description of the model and any special features (see p. 66)
- Conclusions regarding patterns in the data (if any);
*** Summary of conclusions
** Model assessment 
*** Overview of assessments process and results including any deviations from the plan
For each model:
- Detailed assessment of model including measurements such as acuracy and interpretation of behavior 
- Any comments on models by domain or data experts
- Summary assessment of model 
- Insights into why a certain modeling technique and certain parameter settings led to good/bad results
- Summary assessment of complete model set

* Evaluation 
** Assessment of data mining results with respect to business success criteria
- Review of Business Objectives and Business Success Criteria (which may have changed during and/or as a result of data mining) 
- Review of Project Success; has the project achieved the original Business Objectives?
- Are there new business objectives to be addresses later in the project or in new projects? 
- Conclusions for future data mining projects
** Review of process
** List of possible actions
* Deployment
** Deployment plan 
*** Summary of deployable results

** Monitoring and maintenance plan
*** Overview of results deployment and indication of which may require updating (and why)
For each deployed result:
- Description of how updating will be triggered 
- Description of how updating will be performed 
*** Summary of the results updating process
** Final report 
- Summary of Business Understanding: background, objectives and success criteria.
- Summary of data mining process.
- Summary of data mining results.
- Summary of results evaluation.
- Summary of deployment and maintenance plans.
- Cost/benefit analysis.
